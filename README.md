## Source code for higher order approximations in discrete exterior calculus

This source code contains an implementation of higher order approximations in discrete exterior calculus. It is based on the following thesis:

> Jonni Lohi. *Higher order approximations in discrete exterior calculus.* PhD thesis, University of Jyväskylä, 2023.

The source code uses components from the library https://github.com/juolrabi/gfd and is therefore licensed under the same GNU General Public License v3.0. The required code files from that library are distributed in the folder “GFD” with slight modifications.

The folder “Examples” contains code examples illustrating the usage of the implementation, including also the numerical examples considered in [1]. Instructions on how to reproduce the results of [1] are provided in the file “instructions.pdf”.
